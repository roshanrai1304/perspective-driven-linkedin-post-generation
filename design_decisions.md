# Design Decisions and Limitations

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Prompt Engineering Approach**:
   - Used structured prompts with clear sections for article content, physician perspectives, and output format
   - Explicitly requested first-person voice to maintain authenticity
   - Included specific instructions for tone, length, and content structure
   - Requested a confidence score and reasoning to enable quality assessment

2. **Confidence Scoring**:
   - Primary method: Ask the model to self-evaluate alignment with provided perspectives
   - Fallback method: Keyword-based matching as a heuristic when self-evaluation fails
   - Score normalization to 0-1 range for consistency

3. **Flexibility**:
   - Support for both URL inputs and direct article summaries
   - Configurable word count
   - Ability to override default perspectives with custom ones

4. **Implementation Architecture**:
   - Separation of concerns: Core generator class, API layer, and CLI interface
   - Reusable components that can be integrated into larger systems
   - Error handling at multiple levels

## Limitations

1. **Content Extraction**:
   - The URL content extraction is basic and may not work well for all websites
   - More sophisticated article extraction would require specialized libraries

2. **Perspective Alignment**:
   - The confidence scoring is an approximation and may not perfectly capture alignment
   - More sophisticated evaluation would require human feedback or fine-tuned evaluation models

3. **Model Limitations**:
   - Gemini may occasionally generate content that doesn't fully align with the physician's perspective
   - The model might sometimes ignore specific instructions about format or length

4. **Scalability**:
   - The current implementation processes one request at a time
   - For production use, would need to implement rate limiting, caching, and async processing

5. **Customization Depth**:
   - The current implementation captures perspectives as simple statements
   - A more sophisticated approach might model the physician's voice, common phrases, and writing style

## Future Improvements

1. Implement a feedback loop to improve perspective alignment over time
2. Add more sophisticated content extraction for URLs
3. Expand the confidence scoring to include multiple dimensions (tone, perspective alignment, professionalism)
4. Create a fine-tuning dataset based on approved posts to improve generation quality
5. Add support for multimedia content generation (suggested images, hashtags)
